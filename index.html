  <p>My first experience with <b>computers</b> dates all the way back to around 1989 when I played <i>Number muncher</i> in class the first time. 
  Back then it was in AP Math that we were afforded the opportunity to see our first computers. 
  It was then that I fell in love with the PC and what it could do. 
  From that moment on I have spent my life building my own computers over the years and doing my best to keep up with rapidly growing technology.</p> 

  <p>I have always wanted to learn to code and become a major contributor to this world but back when I was young the ability to code was seen more as illegal hackers or government types trying to stop them. 
  So I resolved myself to learn a bit of HTML, a bit of JAVA and gaming. 
  For a long time I forgot about my dream to code and ran my own LLC making a fair bit of money in the process. </p>
  
  <p>Now in 2024 I find that there are classes teaching software engineering and coding. 
  So it is time to fulfill my dream of becoming a coder. I have signed up for USF, coding bootcamp to get the ball rolling and look forward to kicking down the doors of the coding world!</p>
