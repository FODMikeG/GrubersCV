const shiftValue = randomInt + 3; // Shift the range to get an integer between 3 and 33

// ## Question 1 ðŸ¤” Why did we add 1 to the difference between 33 and 3?

// because int start at 0 not 1 so if we did not add 1 it would be from 32 to 2 not 3 to 33.

//## Question 2 ðŸ¤” How does multiplying `randomDecimal` by `range` help us get a number within our desired range?

// because it make a random range is a random int of int 33 - 3 the int is actual -1 of the number or letter in then case so we have to add 1 to get back to what we think the letter should be.

// ## Question 3 ðŸ¤”  Why do we use the `Math.floor()` function instead of other rounding methods like `Math.round()`?

// because Math.floor() will shop off all the extra numbers past the . and Math.round will round it. That could out ight change the number more and break the cypher.

// ## Question 4 ðŸ¤”  How does adding 3 to `randomInt` ensure that our final `shiftValue` is between 3 and 33?


// Because Since randomInt is a number between 0 and range - 1 (which is 30 in this case), adding 3 shifts this range upward, resulting in numbers between 3 and 33.
